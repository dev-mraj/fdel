# fdel - Window long pathnames delete programme

There are many times when node_modules folder is not easy to delete. That's why here is little command that can help anyone.
it will delete complete folder and before deleting it will shorten all directories name to single letter.


```sh
npm install fdel -g
```

then just go to folder and remove it like so

```sh
fdel ./any_path
```

There are still few thing that need to improve in this, will do later on when get some free time.
